#Â Clustering of Iris Dataset

- The Iris dataset is a famous dataset used in machine learning for classification problems.
- The dataset contains 150 instances of iris flowers with their corresponding features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and the class of the flower.
- The dataset is divided into 3 classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica.

- In this project, I will use unsupervised learning to cluster the dataset based on the features of the flowers without any prior knowledge of the species.
